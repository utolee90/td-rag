Democratic Party nominee and former opposition leader Lee Jae-myung defeated the ruling People Power Party nominee Kim Moon-soo and Reform Party nominee Lee Jun-seok.\\n\\nThey were the ninth presidential elections since the 1987 democratization and the establishment of the Sixth Republic, the second to be held following an impeachment, and the first to take place in a year different from the original schedule.[1] Originally scheduled for 3 March 2027, the election was moved up to 3 June 2025, following the impeachment and removal of Yoon Suk Yeol. An early election is required by the constitution of South Korea within 60 days of a presidential vacancy. The 2025 early election was triggered by the 4 April decision of the Constitutional Court of Korea that removed Yoon from office. Later, the government officially called an election for 3 June – the second snap presidential election in South Korean history.[2]\\n\\nLee, who narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon, ran again. Voter turnout was 79.38%, the highest since the 1997 presidential election.[3][4] Campaign issues included the 2024 martial law crisis, infighting within the PPP, the economy, housing costs, political polarization, Trump tariffs, gender equality, cost-of-living crisis, and the aging crisis.\\n\\nBackground [ edit ]\\n\\nFollowing the martial law declaration by then-President Yoon Suk Yeol on 3 December 2024, the National Assembly voted to impeach him on 14 December 2024, with 204 lawmakers voting in favor, out of the National Assembly\\'s total membership of 300.[5][6] The Constitutional Court of Korea upheld the impeachment on 4 April 2025, removing Yoon from office. Under the constitution, a presidential election must be held within 60 days to determine Yoon\\'s successor as the country\\'s 14th president.[7][8][9] On 8 April, acting president Han Duck-soo called an election for 3 June 2025.[10][11]\\n\\nElectoral system [ edit ]\\n\\nThe president of South Korea is elected via a single-round plurality voting system. Presidents are limited to a single five-year term, with no possibility of re-election.[1] Unlike regularly scheduled presidential elections, in a snap election, the winner takes office the moment the National Election Commission chair certifies the votes and strikes the gavel three times, without the normal two-month transition period.[12][13]\\n\\nNominations [ edit ]\\n\\nThe National Election Commission (NEC) opened preliminary candidate registration on 4 April 2025. Incumbent heads of municipal governments who chose to run for president were required to resign from their existing positions by 4 May.[14]\\n\\nDemocratic Party [ edit ]\\n\\nOn 10 April, Lee Jae-myung announced his candidacy. He ran on reducing economic inequality, growing the economy through investments, and strengthening diplomatic relations with the United States and Japan.[15] Lee also pledged to relocate the Office of the President and National Assembly to Sejong City.[16] Lee further promised to codify Sejong City\\'s status as South Korea\\'s administrative capital.[17]\\n\\nOn 12 April 2025, the Democratic Party of Korea announced that its presidential primary would equally weight between votes by dues-paying members and a public poll conducted by two polling companies that would survey one million people. The final decision would be released on 27 April, following a full party vote on 14 April and an online vote by its central committee on 15 April. This was the first DPK primary to include participants aged 16 to 18, following a 2022 revision to the Political Parties Act that lowered the minimum party membership age from 18 to 16.[18][19] On 18 April, the Democratic Party held its first televised debate.[20] On 23 April, the party held its second televised debate. During the debate, the three candidates discussed constitutional amendments to either shorten presidential terms or allow multiple terms, and when the changes would take effect.[21] On 27 April, the party officially nominated Lee Jae-myung after a primary landslide.[22]\\n\\nNominee [ edit ]\\n\\nDPK leader (2022–2025) and Assemblyman Lee Jae-myung,[15] resigned from DPK leadership on 9 April,[23] announced his presidential bid on 10 April, and won the nomination on 27 April.\\n\\nKim Kyoung-soo was sentenced to prison in July 2021 and disqualified from running for public office until April 2028, but he was pardoned in August 2024, restoring his eligibility.[31]\\n\\nPeople Power Party [ edit ]\\n\\nOn 3 May 2025, the People Power Party (PPP) held a primary and announced the nominee at its party convention.[32] Following three rounds of voting, former Minister of Employment and Labor Kim Moon-soo was won the party nomination.[33] However, the PPP\\'s leadership forced a rescission of Kim\\'s nomination in the early hours of 10 May, citing Kim\\'s refusal to undergo a candidate unification process with Han Duck-soo.[34] Han was subsequently made a member of the PPP and declared as the PPP\\'s nominee. Kim referred to the move as a midnight \"coup d\\'état.\"[35] The sudden switch faced harsh criticism from within the party, since Han had not participated in the PPP primary, leading to accusations of free-riding.[36] A PPP membership-wide vote on approving the switch was held on 10 May from 10:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. KST. PPP members rejected the switch and reinstated Kim Moon-soo as the PPP\\'s presidential candidate.[37]\\n\\nNominee [ edit ]\\n\\nKim Moon-soo, Minister of Employment and Labor (2024–2025) (Announced bid on 9 April, won nomination on 3 May, nomination rescinded on 10 May, nomination subsequently reinstated on 10 May)\\n\\nPeople Power 21st Presidential Primary Election on 3 May 2025 [ 51 ] Candidate Results Votes from party members Poll Sum Kim Moon-soo Nominated 246,519 (61.25%) 208,525 (51.81%) 455,044 (56.53%) Han Dong-hoon Eliminated 155,961 (38.75%) 193,955 (48.19%) 349,916 (43.47%)\\n\\nNominees [ edit ]\\n\\nIndependents [ edit ]\\n\\nOn 9 April 2025, former prime minister and acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn announced his presidential bid.[64] Hwang officially registered as an independent candidate on 11 May.[55]\\n\\nOn 1 May 2025, Han Duck-soo resigned as acting president and concurrent prime minister of South Korea[65] and announced his presidential bid the next day.[66][67] Han pledged to amend the constitution to allow up to two four-year terms.[68] Han committed to resigning immediately upon a successful amendment.[69]\\n\\nIndependent candidate Song Jin-ho filed his candidacy on 11 May.

He has refused calls to unify his campaign with Democratic candidate Lee Jae-myung, saying \"independent progressive politics must continue.\" Kwon promises to enact an anti-discrimination law and will work to create an equal society without gaps. As a \"street lawyer,\" Kwon was instrumental in the 2015 Supreme Court decision to legalize the Migrant Workers\\' Trade Union and promises to overhaul Korea\\'s immigration system.[80]\\n\\nKwon and the Democratic Labor Party have qualified to appear in the televised presidential debates.\\n\\nOn 15 May, defeated candidate and former KCTU chairman Han Sang-gyun called for unity at a Busan press conference, saying, \"This is the result of the desperation of not having a voice in an unequal world. We need to build on this power to create a decisive moment that will transform Korean society.\"[81]\\n\\nCampaign developments [ edit ]\\n\\nDemocratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung faced legal troubles that could have barred him from being elected president. Under the Public Official Election Act, individuals fined more than 1 million won are disqualified from holding public office for five years, while those sentenced to imprisonment are disqualified for ten years.[85] On 23 March, the Seoul High Court reversed a lower-court decision that had sentenced Lee to one year in prison with a two-year probation, restoring his eligibility.[86] However, on 2 May, his eligibility was again called into question when the Supreme Court fast-tracked a typically months-long deliberation process, issuing a swift 10–2 decision that overturned his acquittal and remanded the case to the Seoul High Court for retrial.[87] The retrial was initially set for 15 May but later postponed to 18 June, after Election Day.[88]\\n\\nThe two leading conservative candidates Han Duck-soo and Kim Moon-soo were expected to consolidate their campaigns, with one stepping down to support the other.[89] Han said he would not file his candidacy until a final agreement is reached with Kim on a \"unified\" candidate,[90] while Kim claimed that the PPP and its chair Kwon Young-se had unilaterally moved to \"unify\" candidates without consulting him. Kim Jae-won, Chief of Staff for Kim Moon-soo, also stated that the party would likely move to strip Kim\\'s nomination if he did not agree to \"unify\" with Han.[91] After a Kim–Han meeting on 7 May failed to produce an agreement, PPP floor leader Kweon Seong-dong began a hunger strike to push a common candidacy.[92]\\n\\nOn 8 May, Kim and Han held a televised public meeting in front of the National Assembly Proceeding Hall. They failed to reach an agreement, again. Afterward, they said a decision should be made the following day. Kim proposed a one-week campaign and survey to pick which candidate would lead a potential ticket. Kweon criticized Kim, calling him \"pathetic\" for wanting to remain in the race. Kim accused the PPP of trying to push him out after he was chosen as the official nominee less than a week earlier, questioning the purpose of the process.[93][94] On 9 May, the Seoul Southern District Court dismissed Kim\\'s request for an injunction, seeking to compel the PPP to recognize him as the nominee.[95] That same day at a press conference, Kim rebuffed the idea of candidate unification, claiming he would have a better chance of winning the election if the PPP leadership did not \"sabotage\" him. In response, Kwon called Kim\\'s stance disappointing and said, “A true leader must know how to let go.” Kim abruptly left in the middle of the press conference.[96]\\n\\nThe PPP confirmed early on 10 May that they would outright cancel the nomination of Kim and instead nominate Han at an emergency convention the same day. Kim vowed countermeasures, criticized the breakdown of intra-party democracy, and announced that he would seek legal action against the party.[39][97] Later that day, members of the PPP rejected a resolution designating Han as the party\\'s candidate following an all-party vote, resulting in Kim\\'s nomination being reinstated.[98] Han issued an apology over the dispute in the PPP.[99] On 11 May, Han officially ended his campaign,[100] and pledged to support Kim\\'s candidacy.[101] He rejected an offer by Kim to serve as his campaign chair.[102][103] On 17 May, Yoon Suk Yeol left the PPP and endorsed Kim Moon-soo.[104][105]\\n\\nOn 29 May 2025, South Korean representatives of businesses at the former Kaesong Industrial Region held a press conference at the National Assembly, claiming that American investor Jim Rogers endorsed Lee Jae-myung by reading what was purportedly a letter from Rogers.[106] However, Rogers has since constantly denied supporting the candidate.[107]\\n\\nDebates [ edit ]\\n\\nOn 18 May, the first televised debate for the presidential election was held, with Kim Moon-soo, Kwon Yeong-guk, Lee Jun-seok and Lee Jae-myung in attendance.[108] A second debate for candidates who did not qualify for the first was held on 19 May. As Koo Joo-wa dropped out that same day, the debate featured only Hwang Kyo-ahn and Song Jin-ho.[109] A third debate on 23 May featured Lee Jae-myung, Kim Moon-soo, Lee Jun-seok and Kwon Yeong-guk.[110]\\n\\nThe final televised debate of the campaign was held on 27 May, with Lee Jae-myung, Kwon Yeong-guk, Kim Moon-soo and Lee Jun-seok in attendance. During the debate, Kim said that calling Yoon Suk Yeol\\'s martial law declaration a coup attempt before it could be ruled as such by a court was premature and misleading, leading Lee Jae-myung to criticize him for defending a \"coup regime\".[111] Meanwhile, Lee Jun-seok asked Kwon Yeong-guk whether he thought sticking chopsticks in female genitalia was sexist.[112][113] The following day, Lee Jun-seok apologized for using graphic profanity during the debate.[114] On 30 May, 21 representatives from across five parties proposed expelling Lee Jun-seok from the National Assembly over his remarks,[115] with him saying \"The Democratic Party and its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary factions say they will expel me from my position as a member of parliament\",[116] whilst also saying that it\\'s a \"prelude to a dictatorship.\"[117]\\n\\nVoting [ edit ]\\n\\nOverseas polling location in Toronto.\\n\\nOverseas voting began on 19 May, with more than 258,000 South Korean nationals eligible to vote at 223 polling stations across 118 countries until 25 May.[118] Turnout was estimated to be at 79.5%, the highest since the introduction of absentee voting in South Korea in 2012.[119]\\n\\nInterior of polling booth used in this election.\\n\\nEarly voting in South Korea was held on 29 and 30 May, with a turnout of 34.74%.[120] On 29 May, a contract employee of the NEC was arrested in Gangnam and subsequently dismissed for casting a vote on her husband\\'s behalf before casting another vote for herself.[121] The NEC\\'s chair, Roh Tae-ak, and secretary general Kim Yong-bin apologized amid criticism over incidents of poor ballot management during early voting, including the double-voting incident and ballots being taken outside polling stations by queuing voters. Roh also accused a civic group raising an election fraud claim of systemically interfering in the running of the vote, saying that some NEC workers sustained injuries and that a break-in occurred at the office of an election watchdog.[122]\\n\\nOpinion polls [ edit ]\\n\\nPer the Public Official Election Act, release of polling results concerning election candidates is prohibited from six days from the election day until the close of voting.[85]\\n\\nLOESS curve for the next South Korean presidential election since 12 May with a 2-day average\\n\\nLOESS curve for the next South Korean presidential election before nominees were finalised with a 5-day average\\n\\nExit polls [ edit ]\\n\\nOn 3 June exit polls revealed that Lee Jae-myung received the highest number of votes at 51.7% and was therefore projected to win the election and become the next South Korean president after Yoon Suk Yeol.

He emphasized, \"This is a victory for the people and a victory for democracy\", and pledged to faithfully fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to him. Lee expressed his commitment to building \"a nation for ordinary citizens\" and affirmed that presidential power must be exercised not for personal gain but solely for the welfare of the people and the future of the country.[126]\\n\\nFollowing his inauguration, Lee Jae-myung delivered a statement titled \"Message to the People after the Oath of Office\" on 4 June 2025. He pledged to become \"a president for everyone, embracing and serving all citizens regardless of whom they supported\", and vowed to restore dialogue, compromise, and a politics of coexistence and national unity.[127]\\n\\nPeople Power Party candidate Kim Moon-soo delivered a concession speech in the early hours of 4 June 2025, stating that he \"humbly accepts the choice of the people\" and congratulated Lee Jae-myung on his victory. He expressed gratitude for the public\\'s support throughout the campaign and thanked party members for their dedication and efforts. Kim emphasized that the Republic of Korea has always advanced through the power of its people, regardless of crisis, and conveyed appreciation for the democratic will show by voters during a politically turbulent time.[128][129]\\n\\nKim\\'s defeat triggered immediate calls for reform within the PPP.[130] Former party leader Han Dong-hoon argued that voters had issued \"a firm order of expulsion against illegal martial law and the outdated politics that defended it\". Lawmaker Han Ji-ah demanded the entire leadership step down “without delay\" to rebuild public trust. Floor leader Kwon Seong-dong countered that the party must first \"restore a sense of community and end internal strife\" to confront the now-governing Democratic Party.[131] On 5 June, PPP floor leader Kweon Seong-dong resigned to take responsibility for the election result.[132]\\n\\nLee Jun-seok, who had pledged to surpass the 10% and even 15% threshold in order to secure public election subsidies, took responsibility for the Reform Party\\'s underperformance in the election.[133] He expressed his gratitude to every party member and supporter, stating that the Reform New Party had now gained experience through both legislative and presidential elections. He emphasized the need for a thorough review of the party\\'s strengths and weaknesses and set the goal of achieving further progress in the upcoming local elections one year from now.[134] He also expressed respect for president-elect Lee Jae-myung and called on the new government to prioritize national unity and respond to the current economic challenges with precision and careful judgment. Lee reaffirmed that the Reform Party would continue to serve as a constructive opposition party and maintain its role in holding the administration accountable.[135]\\n\\nIn a statement to Yonhap News Agency after the election, an unnamed White House official wrote \"While South Korea had a free and fair election, the United States remains concerned and opposed to Chinese interference and influence in democracies around the world.\"[136][137][138]', 'authors': ['Wikipedia'], 'publish_date': '2018/12/31'}, {'url': 'https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/politics/presidential-candidates-dg/', 'title': '2024 Presidential Candidates - CNN', 'doc_id': 'search_20250612_094050_How many p', 'text': '2024 Presidential Candidates\\n\\nBy CNN Staff\\n\\nUpdated October 21, 2024\\n\\nFormer President Donald Trump is the Republican presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic nominee.

Later, the government officially called an election for 3 June – the second snap presidential election in South Korean history.[2]\\n\\nLee, who narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon, ran again. Voter turnout was 79.38%, the highest since the 1997 presidential election.[3][4] Campaign issues included the 2024 martial law crisis, infighting within the PPP, the economy, housing costs, political polarization, Trump tariffs, gender equality, cost-of-living crisis, and the aging crisis.\\n\\nBackground [ edit ]\\n\\nFollowing the martial law declaration by then-President Yoon Suk Yeol on 3 December 2024, the National Assembly voted to impeach him on 14 December 2024, with 204 lawmakers voting in favor, out of the National Assembly\\'s total membership of 300.[5][6] The Constitutional Court of Korea upheld the impeachment on 4 April 2025, removing Yoon from office. Under the constitution, a presidential election must be held within 60 days to determine Yoon\\'s successor as the country\\'s 14th president.[7][8][9] On 8 April, acting president Han Duck-soo called an election for 3 June 2025.[10][11]\\n\\nElectoral system [ edit ]\\n\\nThe president of South Korea is elected via a single-round plurality voting system. Presidents are limited to a single five-year term, with no possibility of re-election.[1] Unlike regularly scheduled presidential elections, in a snap election, the winner takes office the moment the National Election Commission chair certifies the votes and strikes the gavel three times, without the normal two-month transition period.[12][13]\\n\\nNominations [ edit ]\\n\\nThe National Election Commission (NEC) opened preliminary candidate registration on 4 April 2025. Incumbent heads of municipal governments who chose to run for president were required to resign from their existing positions by 4 May.[14]\\n\\nDemocratic Party [ edit ]\\n\\nOn 10 April, Lee Jae-myung announced his candidacy. He ran on reducing economic inequality, growing the economy through investments, and strengthening diplomatic relations with the United States and Japan.[15] Lee also pledged to relocate the Office of the President and National Assembly to Sejong City.[16] Lee further promised to codify Sejong City\\'s status as South Korea\\'s administrative capital.[17]\\n\\nOn 12 April 2025, the Democratic Party of Korea announced that its presidential primary would equally weight between votes by dues-paying members and a public poll conducted by two polling companies that would survey one million people. The final decision would be released on 27 April, following a full party vote on 14 April and an online vote by its central committee on 15 April. This was the first DPK primary to include participants aged 16 to 18, following a 2022 revision to the Political Parties Act that lowered the minimum party membership age from 18 to 16.[18][19] On 18 April, the Democratic Party held its first televised debate.[20] On 23 April, the party held its second televised debate. During the debate, the three candidates discussed constitutional amendments to either shorten presidential terms or allow multiple terms, and when the changes would take effect.[21] On 27 April, the party officially nominated Lee Jae-myung after a primary landslide.[22]\\n\\nNominee [ edit ]\\n\\nDPK leader (2022–2025) and Assemblyman Lee Jae-myung,[15] resigned from DPK leadership on 9 April,[23] announced his presidential bid on 10 April, and won the nomination on 27 April.\\n\\nKim Kyoung-soo was sentenced to prison in July 2021 and disqualified from running for public office until April 2028, but he was pardoned in August 2024, restoring his eligibility.[31]\\n\\nPeople Power Party [ edit ]\\n\\nOn 3 May 2025, the People Power Party (PPP) held a primary and announced the nominee at its party convention.[32] Following three rounds of voting, former Minister of Employment and Labor Kim Moon-soo was won the party nomination.[33] However, the PPP\\'s leadership forced a rescission of Kim\\'s nomination in the early hours of 10 May, citing Kim\\'s refusal to undergo a candidate unification process with Han Duck-soo.[34] Han was subsequently made a member of the PPP and declared as the PPP\\'s nominee. Kim referred to the move as a midnight \"coup d\\'état.\"[35] The sudden switch faced harsh criticism from within the party, since Han had not participated in the PPP primary, leading to accusations of free-riding.[36] A PPP membership-wide vote on approving the switch was held on 10 May from 10:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. KST. PPP members rejected the switch and reinstated Kim Moon-soo as the PPP\\'s presidential candidate.[37]\\n\\nNominee [ edit ]\\n\\nKim Moon-soo, Minister of Employment and Labor (2024–2025) (Announced bid on 9 April, won nomination on 3 May, nomination rescinded on 10 May, nomination subsequently reinstated on 10 May)\\n\\nPeople Power 21st Presidential Primary Election on 3 May 2025 [ 51 ] Candidate Results Votes from party members Poll Sum Kim Moon-soo Nominated 246,519 (61.25%) 208,525 (51.81%) 455,044 (56.53%) Han Dong-hoon Eliminated 155,961 (38.75%) 193,955 (48.19%) 349,916 (43.47%)\\n\\nNominees [ edit ]\\n\\nIndependents [ edit ]\\n\\nOn 9 April 2025, former prime minister and acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn announced his presidential bid.[64] Hwang officially registered as an independent candidate on 11 May.[55]\\n\\nOn 1 May 2025, Han Duck-soo resigned as acting president and concurrent prime minister of South Korea[65] and announced his presidential bid the next day.[66][67] Han pledged to amend the constitution to allow up to two four-year terms.[68] Han committed to resigning immediately upon a successful amendment.[69]\\n\\nIndependent candidate Song Jin-ho filed his candidacy on 11 May. Song\\'s registration documents disclosed 17 prior criminal convictions.[70]\\n\\nProgressive Party [ edit ]\\n\\nOn 19 April, the Progressive Party selected Kim Jae-yeon as its presidential candidate.[61] She withdrew on 9 May, citing a need to primarily stop the PPP, and endorsed Lee Jae-myung.[58]\\n\\nLiberal Unification Party [ edit ]\\n\\nAfter declaring his candidacy on 24 April, Jeon Kwang-hoon was found ineligible to run due to previous election law violations.[71] Jeon\\'s Liberal Unification Party subsequently nominated lawyer Koo Joo-wa as its presidential candidate on 9 May.\\n\\nRebuilding Korea Party [ edit ]\\n\\nOn 27 April, the Rebuilding Korea Party endorsed Lee Jae-myung of Democratic Party for the presidency.[72]\\n\\nNew Future Democratic Party [ edit ]\\n\\nLee Nak-yon hinted at a campaign for president at the National Convention for Constitutional Revision hosted by the New Future Democratic Party.[73] On 30 April, Lee\\'s campaign advisor announced Lee\\'s candidacy registration, effectively making his campaign official.[74] However, on 10 May, Lee decided against a run, and did not endorse a candidate.[75] On 27 May, Lee announced that he endorses Kim Moon-soo.[76]\\n\\nSocial Transformation Solidarity Conference (Democratic Labor Party) [ edit ]\\n\\nThe Green Party, Justice Party, Labor Party, and several labor unions agreed to have an open primary and field candidates under the banner of Social Transformation.[77] Kwon Yeong-guk won the primary and was nominated as the Democratic Labor Party\\'s presidential candidate on 30 April.[78][79]\\n\\nKwon has pledged a complete \"liquidation of insurrectionist forces\" following the martial law crisis and Yoon\\'s impeachment. He has refused calls to unify his campaign with Democratic candidate Lee Jae-myung, saying \"independent progressive politics must continue.\" Kwon promises to enact an anti-discrimination law and will work to create an equal society without gaps. As a \"street lawyer,\" Kwon was instrumental in the 2015 Supreme Court decision to legalize the Migrant Workers\\' Trade Union and promises to overhaul Korea\\'s immigration system.[80]\\n\\nKwon and the Democratic Labor Party have qualified to appear in the televised presidential debates.\\n\\nOn 15 May, defeated candidate and former KCTU chairman Han Sang-gyun called for unity at a Busan press conference, saying, \"This is the result of the desperation of not having a voice in an unequal world. We need to build on this power to create a decisive moment that will transform Korean society.\"[81]\\n\\nCampaign developments [ edit ]\\n\\nDemocratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung faced legal troubles that could have barred him from being elected president. Under the Public Official Election Act, individuals fined more than 1 million won are disqualified from holding public office for five years, while those sentenced to imprisonment are disqualified for ten years.[85] On 23 March, the Seoul High Court reversed a lower-court decision that had sentenced Lee to one year in prison with a two-year probation, restoring his eligibility.[86] However, on 2 May, his eligibility was again called into question when the Supreme Court fast-tracked a typically months-long deliberation process, issuing a swift 10–2 decision that overturned his acquittal and remanded the case to the Seoul High Court for retrial.[87] The retrial was initially set for 15 May but later postponed to 18 June, after Election Day.[88]\\n\\nThe two leading conservative candidates Han Duck-soo and Kim Moon-soo were expected to consolidate their campaigns, with one stepping down to support the other.[89] Han said he would not file his candidacy until a final agreement is reached with Kim on a \"unified\" candidate,[90] while Kim claimed that the PPP and its chair Kwon Young-se had unilaterally moved to \"unify\" candidates without consulting him. Kim Jae-won, Chief of Staff for Kim Moon-soo, also stated that the party would likely move to strip Kim\\'s nomination if he did not agree to \"unify\" with Han.[91] After a Kim–Han meeting on 7 May failed to produce an agreement, PPP floor leader Kweon Seong-dong began a hunger strike to push a common candidacy.[92]\\n\\nOn 8 May, Kim and Han held a televised public meeting in front of the National Assembly Proceeding Hall. They failed to reach an agreement, again. Afterward, they said a decision should be made the following day. Kim proposed a one-week campaign and survey to pick which candidate would lead a potential ticket. Kweon criticized Kim, calling him \"pathetic\" for wanting to remain in the race. Kim accused the PPP of trying to push him out after he was chosen as the official nominee less than a week earlier, questioning the purpose of the process.[93][94] On 9 May, the Seoul Southern District Court dismissed Kim\\'s request for an injunction, seeking to compel the PPP to recognize him as the nominee.[95] That same day at a press conference, Kim rebuffed the idea of candidate unification, claiming he would have a better chance of winning the election if the PPP leadership did not \"sabotage\" him. In response, Kwon called Kim\\'s stance disappointing and said, “A true leader must know how to let go.” Kim abruptly left in the middle of the press conference.[96]\\n\\nThe PPP confirmed early on 10 May that they would outright cancel the nomination of Kim and instead nominate Han at an emergency convention the same day. Kim vowed countermeasures, criticized the breakdown of intra-party democracy, and announced that he would seek legal action against the party.[39][97] Later that day, members of the PPP rejected a resolution designating Han as the party\\'s candidate following an all-party vote, resulting in Kim\\'s nomination being reinstated.[98] Han issued an apology over the dispute in the PPP.[99] On 11 May, Han officially ended his campaign,[100] and pledged to support Kim\\'s candidacy.[101] He rejected an offer by Kim to serve as his campaign chair.[102][103] On 17 May, Yoon Suk Yeol left the PPP and endorsed Kim Moon-soo.[104][105]\\n\\nOn 29 May 2025, South Korean representatives of businesses at the former Kaesong Industrial Region held a press conference at the National Assembly, claiming that American investor Jim Rogers endorsed Lee Jae-myung by reading what was purportedly a letter from Rogers.[106] However, Rogers has since constantly denied supporting the candidate.[107]\\n\\nDebates [ edit ]\\n\\nOn 18 May, the first televised debate for the presidential election was held, with Kim Moon-soo, Kwon Yeong-guk, Lee Jun-seok and Lee Jae-myung in attendance.[108] A second debate for candidates who did not qualify for the first was held on 19 May. As Koo Joo-wa dropped out that same day, the debate featured only Hwang Kyo-ahn and Song Jin-ho.[109] A third debate on 23 May featured Lee Jae-myung, Kim Moon-soo, Lee Jun-seok and Kwon Yeong-guk.[110]\\n\\nThe final televised debate of the campaign was held on 27 May, with Lee Jae-myung, Kwon Yeong-guk, Kim Moon-soo and Lee Jun-seok in attendance. During the debate, Kim said that calling Yoon Suk Yeol\\'s martial law declaration a coup attempt before it could be ruled as such by a court was premature and misleading, leading Lee Jae-myung to criticize him for defending a \"coup regime\".[111] Meanwhile, Lee Jun-seok asked Kwon Yeong-guk whether he thought sticking chopsticks in female genitalia was sexist.[112][113] The following day, Lee Jun-seok apologized for using graphic profanity during the debate.[114] On 30 May, 21 representatives from across five parties proposed expelling Lee Jun-seok from the National Assembly over his remarks,[115] with him saying \"The Democratic Party and its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary factions say they will expel me from my position as a member of parliament\",[116] whilst also saying that it\\'s a \"prelude to a dictatorship.\"[117]\\n\\nVoting [ edit ]\\n\\nOverseas polling location in Toronto.\\n\\nOverseas voting began on 19 May, with more than 258,000 South Korean nationals eligible to vote at 223 polling stations across 118 countries until 25 May.[118] Turnout was estimated to be at 79.5%, the highest since the introduction of absentee voting in South Korea in 2012.[119]\\n\\nInterior of polling booth used in this election.\\n\\nEarly voting in South Korea was held on 29 and 30 May, with a turnout of 34.74%.[120] On 29 May, a contract employee of the NEC was arrested in Gangnam and subsequently dismissed for casting a vote on her husband\\'s behalf before casting another vote for herself.[121] The NEC\\'s chair, Roh Tae-ak, and secretary general Kim Yong-bin apologized amid criticism over incidents of poor ballot management during early voting, including the double-voting incident and ballots being taken outside polling stations by queuing voters. Roh also accused a civic group raising an election fraud claim of systemically interfering in the running of the vote, saying that some NEC workers sustained injuries and that a break-in occurred at the office of an election watchdog.[122]\\n\\nOpinion polls [ edit ]\\n\\nPer the Public Official Election Act, release of polling results concerning election candidates is prohibited from six days from the election day until the close of voting.[85]\\n\\nLOESS curve for the next South Korean presidential election since 12 May with a 2-day average\\n\\nLOESS curve for the next South Korean presidential election before nominees were finalised with a 5-day average\\n\\nExit polls [ edit ]\\n\\nOn 3 June exit polls revealed that Lee Jae-myung received the highest number of votes at 51.7% and was therefore projected to win the election and become the next South Korean president after Yoon Suk Yeol.

He emphasized, \"This is a victory for the people and a victory for democracy\", and pledged to faithfully fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to him. Lee expressed his commitment to building \"a nation for ordinary citizens\" and affirmed that presidential power must be exercised not for personal gain but solely for the welfare of the people and the future of the country.[126]\\n\\nFollowing his inauguration, Lee Jae-myung delivered a statement titled \"Message to the People after the Oath of Office\" on 4 June 2025. He pledged to become \"a president for everyone, embracing and serving all citizens regardless of whom they supported\", and vowed to restore dialogue, compromise, and a politics of coexistence and national unity.[127]\\n\\nPeople Power Party candidate Kim Moon-soo delivered a concession speech in the early hours of 4 June 2025, stating that he \"humbly accepts the choice of the people\" and congratulated Lee Jae-myung on his victory. He expressed gratitude for the public\\'s support throughout the campaign and thanked party members for their dedication and efforts. Kim emphasized that the Republic of Korea has always advanced through the power of its people, regardless of crisis, and conveyed appreciation for the democratic will show by voters during a politically turbulent time.[128][129]\\n\\nKim\\'s defeat triggered immediate calls for reform within the PPP.[130] Former party leader Han Dong-hoon argued that voters had issued \"a firm order of expulsion against illegal martial law and the outdated politics that defended it\". Lawmaker Han Ji-ah demanded the entire leadership step down “without delay\" to rebuild public trust. Floor leader Kwon Seong-dong countered that the party must first \"restore a sense of community and end internal strife\" to confront the now-governing Democratic Party.[131] On 5 June, PPP floor leader Kweon Seong-dong resigned to take responsibility for the election result.[132]\\n\\nLee Jun-seok, who had pledged to surpass the 10% and even 15% threshold in order to secure public election subsidies, took responsibility for the Reform Party\\'s underperformance in the election.[133] He expressed his gratitude to every party member and supporter, stating that the Reform New Party had now gained experience through both legislative and presidential elections. He emphasized the need for a thorough review of the party\\'s strengths and weaknesses and set the goal of achieving further progress in the upcoming local elections one year from now.[134] He also expressed respect for president-elect Lee Jae-myung and called on the new government to prioritize national unity and respond to the current economic challenges with precision and careful judgment. Lee reaffirmed that the Reform Party would continue to serve as a constructive opposition party and maintain its role in holding the administration accountable.[135]\\n\\nIn a statement to Yonhap News Agency after the election, an unnamed White House official wrote \"While South Korea had a free and fair election, the United States remains concerned and opposed to Chinese interference and influence in democracies around the world.\"[136][137][138]', 'authors': ['Wikipedia'], 'publish_date': '2018/12/31'}, {'url': 'https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/politics/presidential-candidates-dg/', 'title': '2024 Presidential Candidates - CNN', 'doc_id': 'search_20250612_094050_How many p', 'text': '2024 Presidential Candidates\\n\\nBy CNN Staff\\n\\nUpdated October 21, 2024\\n\\nFormer President Donald Trump is the Republican presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic nominee.

Participants are asked about everything from an airport’s website to the friendliness of its staff, the entertainment facilities to the baggage delivery times, and 575 of them are assessed in total.\\n\\nSo which airport is the best in the world? Well, according to Skytrax, it’s Singapore Changi. This hub was recently named the best airport in the world for food, but according to the survey and despite being one of southeast Asia’s busiest hubs, it’s ‘renowned for its unrivalled passenger experience.’\\n\\nIn second place is Doha Hamad Airport, which slipped into second place after last year’s win.

The award was presented at the 2025 World Airport Awards ceremony held at the Passenger Terminal Expo in Madrid, Spain. The Skytrax award for best regional airport in North America reflects the success of LaGuardia Airport’s historic $8 billion transformation from worst to best in the nation.\\n\\nThe World Airport Awards from Skytrax are the most prestigious accolades for the airport industry, voted by customers in the largest, annual global airport customer satisfaction survey. The awards are recognized as the quality benchmark for the world airport industry, assessing customer service and facilities across more than 565 airports.\\n\\n“A decade ago, the suggestion that LaGuardia Airport would one day be recognized on the world stage as the best regional airport in North America would have been laughable,” said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “But the Port Authority and our private partners have built what we promised – a world-class airport, with inspiring architecture, public art, iconic concessions and state-of-the-art technology that has propelled LaGuardia from worst to best in the nation in the eyes of the critics and passengers alike.”\\n\\n“This prestigious award from Skytrax is another affirmation of the hard work and extraordinary vision that the Port Authority and our partners have invested to reimagine what LaGuardia Airport could be,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “We are no longer imagining what our airports can become – we are realizing our goal to create world-class airports across our region.”\\n\\n“LaGuardia Airport’s evolution over the past decade is nothing short of extraordinary,” said Skytrax CEO Edward Plaisted. “This award is a testament to the dedication and hard work invested in elevating the airport's standards, and Terminal B, in particular, has become a model for regional airports not just in North America, but globally.”\\n\\n“We are so incredibly honored for LaGuardia to be recognized as the best regional airport in North America at the Skytrax World Airport Awards, as well as for Skytrax’s recent awarding our very own Terminal B its second prestigious 5-star rating,” said Suzette Noble, chief executive officer of LaGuardia Gateway Partners, the private manager and developer of LaGuardia Terminal B. “Alongside the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and Delta Airlines, we have transformed LaGuardia into the country’s top airport and this latest distinction underlines our shared commitment to delivering seamless and exceptional guest experiences from curb to gate.”\\n\\n“The recognition of LaGuardia by Skytrax is a significant honor, reflecting Skytrax’s respected expertise within the industry,” said Ryan Marzullo, managing director of New York corporate real estate at Delta Air Lines. “Delta is proud to have played a pivotal role in the reconstruction of our home at LaGuardia – Terminal C – in collaboration with The Port Authority and LaGuardia Gateway Partners. This world-class airport is integral to our enduring commitment to New York, underscoring our dedication to serving and supporting this region.”\\n\\nThe World Airport Awards began in 1999, when Skytrax launched its first global airport customer satisfaction survey. The survey and awards are independent of any airport control or input. The 2025 awards are based on the World Airport Survey questionnaires completed by over 100 nationalities of airport customers during the survey period from August 2024 to February 2025. The survey evaluates the customer experience across all front-line areas of airport service and facilities, from check-in, arrivals, transfers, shopping, security/immigration through to departure at the gate.\\n\\nIn addition to the Skytrax award for LaGuardia Airport, representatives from the Port Authority and LaGuardia Gateway Partners were presented with a plaque for Terminal B, which received its second 5-star rating from Skytrax. LaGuardia Airport’s Terminal B and Newark Liberty International Airport’s new Terminal A are the only two airport terminals in North America to receive 5-star ratings from Skytrax.\\n\\nPort Authority airports, including LaGuardia, Newark Liberty International and John F. Kennedy International (JFK), are undergoing a historic $30 billion transformation with the goal of creating world class and award-winning passenger facilities.

       "   'text': 'By Maureen O’Hare, CNN\\n\\n(CNN) — Killing time in the airport is ordinarily such a drag that there’s a whole TikTok trend devoted to people making it through the terminal in as little time as possible.\\n\\nNot so in Singapore Changi, which has just been crowned the World’s Best Airport for the 13th time by air transport rating organization Skytrax.\\n\\nChangi is a destination in itself, where early check-in has been introduced to allow passengers to drop their bags off up to 48 hours before their flight so they can make their time at the airport part of the vacation.\\n\\nMost will hit the mammoth 10-story Jewel shopping mall, with its footfall of 80 million people in 2024. Then there are the multiple indoor gardens (including a butterfly center) and the 40-meter high Rain Vortex, the world’s largest indoor waterfall (around 130 feet).\\n\\nThere are spas, hotels, art exhibitions, a museum, a cinema; there’s even a dinosaur theme park.\\n\\nSkytrax has also recognized the airport as a gastronomic wonderland. It scooped up the award for World’s Best Airport Dining, as well as those for World’s Best Airport Washrooms and Best Airport in Asia, at the World Airport Awards held in Madrid on April 9.\\n\\nIt’s unlikely to be the last accolade earned by this exemplary airport.\\n\\nChangi is investing more than $2 billion in the next six years on the improvement of services and facilities, CNN Business reported last month.\\n\\nIt’s also set to get even bigger. Work is underway on a fifth terminal to add to the existing four, which will open in the 2030s.\\n\\nAsia leads the way\\n\\nThe world’s no. 2 airport, according to Skytrax’s global survey of customers at 565 airports around the world, is the artwork-filled and architecturally splendid Hamad International in Qatar, easily one of the most luxurious aviation hubs in the world. It also won awards for Best Airport Shopping and Best Airport in the Middle East.\\n\\nAsian airports nabbed spots three through six on the list, proving once again that the region is leaving North America and Europe to play catch-up when it comes to air transport excellence.\\n\\nTokyo Haneda (also named the World’s Cleanest Airport) was at No. 3, followed by Seoul’s Incheon International (also awarded World’s Best Airport Staff), Narita International (serving Tokyo) and Hong Kong International.\\n\\nNine European airports made it into the top 20. At No. 7, Paris Charles de Gaulle was named Best Airport in Europe for the third year in a row. Rome Fiumicino, having a busy year thanks to the Catholic Church’s Jubilee celebrations, was at No. 8.\\n\\nMunich, Zurich and Helsinki-Vantaa were in 9th, 10th and 12th place respectively and Istanbul Airport, on the European side of the continent-straddling city, was at No. 14. Istanbul was also named the World’s Most Family-Friendly Airport.\\n\\nVienna (No. 15), Copenhagen (No. 18) and Amsterdam Schiphol (No. 19) all made the cut, but London Heathrow, the busiest airport in Europe, didn’t pick up any gongs.\\n\\nThe only airport from the Americas to make the list was Vancouver International at No. 13. Cape Town Airport didn’t make the top 20, but was named Best Airport in Africa and Best Airport Staff Service in Africa.\\n\\nThe rest of the top 20 was made up of Dubai International at No. 11, Melbourne at No. 16, Japan’s Chubu Centrair at No. 17 (also named World’s Best Regional Airport) and Bahrain international at No.20.\\n\\nTaiwan Taoyuan International Airport won the award for World’s Best Airport Baggage Delivery, Copenhagen was acclaimed for the World’s Best Airport Security Processing and Hong Kong International scooped the gong for World’s Best Airport Immigration.\\n\\nThe world’s top airports for 2025\\n\\n1.

Well, according to Skytrax, it’s Singapore Changi. This hub was recently named the best airport in the world for food, but according to the survey and despite being one of southeast Asia’s busiest hubs, it’s ‘renowned for its unrivalled passenger experience.’\\n\\nIn second place is Doha Hamad Airport, which slipped into second place after last year’s win. Apparently, it was described as the most architecturally impressive and luxurious terminal complex on the planet – quite the praise, eh?\\n\\nIn third place was Tokyo Haneda Airport, and Seoul Incheon and Tokyo Narita round out the top five.

       "   'text': \"The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced that the world’s preeminent international airport rating organization, Skytrax, has named LaGuardia Airport as the best airport in North America for domestic and short haul international travel. The award was presented at the 2025 World Airport Awards ceremony held at the Passenger Terminal Expo in Madrid, Spain. The Skytrax award for best regional airport in North America reflects the success of LaGuardia Airport’s historic $8 billion transformation from worst to best in the nation.\\n\\nThe World Airport Awards from Skytrax are the most prestigious accolades for the airport industry, voted by customers in the largest, annual global airport customer satisfaction survey. The awards are recognized as the quality benchmark for the world airport industry, assessing customer service and facilities across more than 565 airports.\\n\\n“A decade ago, the suggestion that LaGuardia Airport would one day be recognized on the world stage as the best regional airport in North America would have been laughable,” said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “But the Port Authority and our private partners have built what we promised – a world-class airport, with inspiring architecture, public art, iconic concessions and state-of-the-art technology that has propelled LaGuardia from worst to best in the nation in the eyes of the critics and passengers alike.”\\n\\n“This prestigious award from Skytrax is another affirmation of the hard work and extraordinary vision that the Port Authority and our partners have invested to reimagine what LaGuardia Airport could be,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “We are no longer imagining what our airports can become – we are realizing our goal to create world-class airports across our region.”\\n\\n“LaGuardia Airport’s evolution over the past decade is nothing short of extraordinary,” said Skytrax CEO Edward Plaisted. “This award is a testament to the dedication and hard work invested in elevating the airport's standards, and Terminal B, in particular, has become a model for regional airports not just in North America, but globally.”\\n\\n“We are so incredibly honored for LaGuardia to be recognized as the best regional airport in North America at the Skytrax World Airport Awards, as well as for Skytrax’s recent awarding our very own Terminal B its second prestigious 5-star rating,” said Suzette Noble, chief executive officer of LaGuardia Gateway Partners, the private manager and developer of LaGuardia Terminal B. “Alongside the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and Delta Airlines, we have transformed LaGuardia into the country’s top airport and this latest distinction underlines our shared commitment to delivering seamless and exceptional guest experiences from curb to gate.”\\n\\n“The recognition of LaGuardia by Skytrax is a significant honor, reflecting Skytrax’s respected expertise within the industry,” said Ryan Marzullo, managing director of New York corporate real estate at Delta Air Lines. “Delta is proud to have played a pivotal role in the reconstruction of our home at LaGuardia – Terminal C – in collaboration with The Port Authority and LaGuardia Gateway Partners. This world-class airport is integral to our enduring commitment to New York, underscoring our dedication to serving and supporting this region.”\\n\\nThe World Airport Awards began in 1999, when Skytrax launched its first global airport customer satisfaction survey. The survey and awards are independent of any airport control or input. The 2025 awards are based on the World Airport Survey questionnaires completed by over 100 nationalities of airport customers during the survey period from August 2024 to February 2025. The survey evaluates the customer experience across all front-line areas of airport service and facilities, from check-in, arrivals, transfers, shopping, security/immigration through to departure at the gate.\\n\\nIn addition to the Skytrax award for LaGuardia Airport, representatives from the Port Authority and LaGuardia Gateway Partners were presented with a plaque for Terminal B, which received its second 5-star rating from Skytrax. LaGuardia Airport’s Terminal B and Newark Liberty International Airport’s new Terminal A are the only two airport terminals in North America to receive 5-star ratings from Skytrax.\\n\\nPort Authority airports, including LaGuardia, Newark Liberty International and John F. Kennedy International (JFK), are undergoing a historic $30 billion transformation with the goal of creating world class and award-winning passenger facilities.
